üìê **UI Implementation Rules**

1. All UI elements must respect the UQAR theme.
2. Reuse styling via a centralized `app_theme.dart` file:
   - Include `AppColors`, `AppTextStyles`, `AppDecorations`
3. All buttons must use consistent shape and gradient (if any).
4. All pages must use `SafeArea` and `SingleChildScrollView` where needed.
5. If no image or icon is present, provide a placeholder with the theme.
6. Generate `uqar_ui_log.md` to track:
   - Screens updated
   - Components created
   - Theming decisions and widgets reused
7. Explain your UI changes clearly, and insert `// UI Design: [reason]` comments in relevant Dart files.
